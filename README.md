# HashiTalks: Deploy - Deploy Federated Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Clusters

This repository is heavily inspired by the [Deploy
Federated Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/multicloud-kubernetes)
on [HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/). It contains Terraform
configuration files for you to use to learn deploy a Consul-federated
multi-cluster Kubernetes setup.

It also contains configuration to deploy the HashiCups using Helm charts.
